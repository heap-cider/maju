# Agent Configuration — Contributor Rules

Scope: `desktop/src/features/agents/` (config surfaces, shared config renderer,
and the agent config core). Read this before changing how harness / provider /
model / effort configuration is modeled, rendered, persisted, or applied.

Plan of record: `Maju/Harness-Provider-Model.md` in Morgan's Obsidian vault
(PR sequence, decisions log). PRs: #2140 (rename), #2148 (flag reduction),
#2156 (honest model states), #2158 (Agent Config Core).

## The one rule

**Static harness facts come from the Rust runtime catalog; session-native
controls come from live ACP `configOptions`.** `KnownAcpRuntime`
(`desktop/src-tauri/src/managed_agents/discovery/runtime_metadata.rs`) declares
install/setup facts and env-backed capabilities. Spawn applies them,
`AcpRuntimeCatalogEntry` exposes them over IPC, and `lib/agentConfigCore.ts`
projects them into field descriptors. Model-dependent controls are different:
the short discovery session is their only source of truth. The frontend maps
ACP categories and scalar types generically and never keeps an adapter-name or
model-suffix lookup table.

**Second metadata source: command-keyed execution policy.**
`harness_max_parallelism` (`managed_agents/parallelism.rs`) maps the harness's
static command string to a spawn-time cap (`OPENCLAW_MAX_PARALLELISM = 5` for
OpenClaw). This cap is not a `KnownAcpRuntime` field because it applies to
preset harnesses (like OpenClaw) that are not in the builtin catalog. It is
projected onto `AcpRuntimeCatalogEntry.max_parallelism` by all four
catalog-producing constructors (builtin discovery, preset catalog, custom
discovery, custom-save response) using the **static definition command**, not
the resolved `entry.command` (which may be `null` for unavailable entries).
The frontend reads `maxParallelism` from the catalog entry and never keeps a
separate constant.

If you need a new capability fact (a new env key, a native option, a "supports
X" flag): add it to `KnownAcpRuntime` first, expose it on
`AcpRuntimeCatalogEntry`, then project it through the core. Do not shortcut
with a TypeScript lookup table or an id comparison in a component.
If an adapter advertises a native option, preserve and render that advertised
shape instead of adding a runtime-ID exception.

## Rules

1. **No hardcoded harness-ID or model-name checks in render code.** Components
   ask the field model what static fields exist, then use the live ACP option's
   `category`, `type`, and choices for native controls.
2. **Effort reads/writes go through its declared source.** Env-backed effort
   uses the descriptor's `currentPersistence` key. ACP-native reasoning uses
   the exact discovered `configId` whose category is `thought_level`; never
   assume the id is `effort`, parse a model suffix, or invent choices.
3. **Native field absence follows discovery, not an adapter omission table.**
   A runtime without static effort defers to live ACP options. If no
   `thought_level` option is advertised, the UI hides the field and leaves the
   engine default alone.
4. **The clearing policy is the named types.** `onContextChange:
   "resetDependentValues"` (user changed harness/provider → dependent values
   reset everywhere) vs `onCatalogMismatch: "explainOnly" | "onboardingCleanup"`
   (an async catalog miss never silently erases saved state outside
   onboarding's named cleanup). Do not add mutation booleans like
   `clearInvalidModel`; extend the policy types.
5. **"Metadata unknown" ≠ "harness lacks the capability".** Passing
   `runtime: undefined` to the core means fields won't render. Surfaces must
   gate on the runtime catalog query settling (loading/error states) rather
   than letting fields silently vanish — see `AgentDefaultsEditor` /
   `DefaultConfigStep` for the pattern.
6. **One canonical behavior, disclosure presets for visibility.** Behavior
   flags were deliberately killed in #2148 (`CANONICAL_CONFIG_BEHAVIORS`).
   Surface differences are expressed via the `disclosure` preset, not new
   boolean props.  **Exception:** `onboarding-essential` hides happy-path
   helper copy (provider/model descriptions) but a non-null model-discovery
   status always bypasses the preset and renders the status line — enforced
   via `shouldShowModelStatusMessage()` (`AgentConfigFields.tsx`).
   Additionally, a successful discovery response that yields no usable options
   (`supportsSwitching:false` or empty model list) synthesizes a warning status
   via `synthesizeEmptyDiscoveryStatus()` and is intentionally **not cached**
   so that closing → reopening the dialog re-runs discovery after the user
   installs or signs into the CLI (`isCacheableDiscoveryResponse()`).
7. **Onboarding setup detects readiness; it does not select defaults.** The
   setup page derives visible and ready harnesses from the runtime catalog and
   only offers install or sign-in actions. The following defaults page is the
   sole onboarding surface that chooses `preferred_runtime`. Its complete draft
   lives in machine-onboarding session state, so Back performs no write and
   restores even incomplete edits when the user returns. Skip abandons that
   draft and advances with zero config writes. Next is the only persistence
   boundary: it consumes the shared renderer's `onValidityChange` signal,
   disables editing while awaiting `set_global_agent_config`, advances only on
   success, and leaves the draft in place with a retryable inline error on
   failure. A harness selection alone does not enable Next when the harness
   requires provider/model/credential config (e.g. maju-agent with no
   provider). Baked build env and runtime-file config satisfy the gate. Drafts
   intentionally do not survive an app restart.
   `onboarding-agent-defaults.spec.ts` is the acceptance gate for anything
   touching this flow or the shared renderer.
8. **Omit the Model control only after a confirmed successful empty
   discovery on an optional-model harness.** When the field model marks model
   as `acpNative` (Claude Code / Codex), `shouldRenderModelControl` hides the
   picker while discovery is in flight and after IPC resolves with no usable
   options (`modelDiscoverySuccessfulEmpty` / `isSuccessfulEmptyDiscovery`).
   A thrown or unavailable discovery keeps the control so #2246 failure UI can
   render, and must not heal/clear persisted model or effort. Full disclosure
   still shows the control when Custom model is available. Required-model
   harnesses always keep the field. Gate: `defaults hides model when optional
   harness has empty discovery` (and the failed-discovery counterpart) in
   `onboarding-agent-defaults.spec.ts`.
9. **The defaults modal is progressively disclosed.** An unset global config
   starts on the Maju Agent-first deployment fallback and carries that visible
   harness into the next saved edit. The `progressive-defaults` disclosure
   preset therefore begins at Provider for Maju Agent, then reveals Model,
   Effort, and Advanced only after a provider is configured. Harnesses whose
   runtime metadata has no provider field skip that gate. Reveals animate their
   height through Motion and become immediate when reduced motion is requested.
   Once the Advanced toggle is visible, its expanded state is exclusively
   user-controlled: provider, harness, and required-env changes must never
   open it automatically in defaults, create, or edit flows. In Create mode,
   `Run on` belongs in Advanced directly after **Who can send instructions**;
   keep it out of the basic create fields. The defaults summary follows
   preferred-harness changes saved while the dialog is open, and its configured
   state includes required credentials as well as provider/model values. If no
   available harness can resolve, Create starts in Customize and lets unavailable
   catalog entries be selected only to expose their setup guidance; submission
   remains blocked.
   Advanced-only required credentials and incomplete remote **Run on** setup
   mark the collapsed Advanced toggle without opening it, and block incomplete
   saves.
   Runtime-file credentials satisfy Global Defaults just as they do Create and
   Edit. In Edit,
   selecting Custom command keeps its required command field beside the harness
   picker rather than hiding it in Advanced.
10. **Catalog visibility is community-scoped relay state, never a global
    definition field.** `AgentDefinition.shared` is only the active
    relay+owner projection returned to the UI. Durable heads and pending
    publications live in the scoped retention database, and explicit share
    toggles await relay acceptance before the UI claims that an agent was
    published or removed. A queued update must stay visibly queued, and the
    catalog itself must render only relay-confirmed publications — never an
    optimistic local persona.
11. **Shared agent access names the consequence where it is selected.** The
   shared respond-to field shows a persistent warning whenever `anyone` **or**
   `allowlist` is selected — both hand the host's access to someone other than
   the owner, so both disclose it and only the audience phrase differs. This
   covers persona-backed create and edit surfaces. Keep that disclosure in
   the shared field instead of adding surface-specific flags. It renders
   directly below the selector for `anyone` but *after* the people picker for
   `allowlist`, so it never sits between the user and the selection they came
   to make. The copy leads with the audience ("Anyone can use this agent to
   access…") so it reads as a warning rather than an explanation, and stays one
   sentence — don't split the mechanism into a second sentence. Both the machine
   and the stakes it names come from `lib/agentAccessWarning.ts`, keyed on an
   optional `runLocation`: instance surfaces resolve it from
   `ManagedAgent.backend` via `runLocationForBackend`, and the create flow from
   `WhereToRunDraft.runOn` via `runLocationForRunOn`. `AgentDialog` is the one
   place that resolves it for dialog surfaces and publishes it through
   `ui/AgentRunLocationContext.tsx`; the field reads that context and lets an
   explicit `runLocation` prop win. Do **not** thread the value as a prop
   through `AgentDefinitionDialog` / `AgentInstanceEditDialog` — both are
   already over the 1000-line ceiling, and neither uses the value itself.
   Surfaces rendered outside `AgentDialog` (e.g. `EditRespondToDialog`) pass the
   prop directly. Local names "your
   computer, including files, accounts, and connected tools"; remote names "the
   server it runs on, including any accounts and tools available there" —
   deliberately *not* the owner's files, which aren't theirs to describe on a
   host they don't own. **An unknown location falls back to the local wording —
   never hedge with "computer or server".** A remote host requires an
   installed `maju-backend-*` provider, and without one `WhereToRunSection`
   never renders, so "server" would name a concept the owner has never been
   shown; when it *is* remote they picked that host from the selector
   themselves. Never synthesize a run location a surface doesn't have. Don't
   expose `respond-to`, `allowlist`, Nostr, or harness jargon in primary UI
   copy. **The owner-only-access build capability is backend-independent.** When
   `getAgentAccessOwnerOnly()` is true, every managed agent's access control is
   locked to owner-only, including provider-backed agents. A provider backend
   does not prove remote execution and must never create a policy carve-out.

## The tests that enforce this

- `lib/agentConfigCore.test.mjs` — field model per harness × scope, clearing
  policy. Update when the capability model changes.
- `lib/acpNativeOptions.test.mjs` and `ui/AcpNativeConfigFields.test.mjs` —
  typed ACP value persistence, category-driven placement, inheritance, and the
  no-duplicate-reasoning contract.
- `ui/agentConfigFieldsContract.test.mjs` — canonical behaviors + disclosure
  presets + `shouldShowModelStatusMessage` status-bypass +
  `shouldRenderModelControl` (successful-empty omit vs failure keep). If this
  fails, you probably reintroduced a per-surface flag or conflated empty with
  failed discovery.
- `ui/usePersonaModelDiscovery.test.mjs` — `synthesizeEmptyDiscoveryStatus`,
  `isCacheableDiscoveryResponse`, `deriveModelDiscoveryPending`,
  `isSuccessfulEmptyDiscovery`. If the "reopen to retry" copy becomes inert
  again, these tests will catch it.
- `ui/respondToFieldContract.test.mjs` — plain-language mode labels, the
  persistent warning contract for shared agent access, and its two render
  positions (after the people picker for `allowlist`).
- `lib/agentAccessWarning.test.mjs` — every mode × run-location copy variant
  plus both resolvers, including unknown-reads-as-local and
  blank-`runOn`-is-not-a-provider.
- `desktop/tests/e2e/onboarding-agent-defaults.spec.ts` — onboarding behavior
  acceptance coverage for readiness, failure states, defaults, session-draft
  restoration, zero-write Skip, Next save failure/retry, navigation, and
  successful-empty vs failed optional-model discovery.
- Rust: `runtime_metadata_env_vars` tests pin spawn-time key application.
- Rust: persona sharing/retention tests pin relay+owner scoping, durable
  enqueue errors, relay rejection/unavailability, and accepted publication.

## Keep this file true

**If you change how agent configuration is modeled, rendered, persisted,
applied, or cleared — update this file in the same PR.** A rule that no longer
matches the code is worse than no rule; a new pattern that isn't written down
here will be broken by the next agent that never learns it existed. Reviewers:
treat a config-behavior diff without a matching AGENTS.md diff (or an explicit
"no rules changed" note) as incomplete.
